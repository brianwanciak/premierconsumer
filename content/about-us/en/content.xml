&lt;h2&gt;History&lt;/h2&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;Our local community was, and still is in &lt;strong&gt;great need of education in home finances.&lt;/strong&gt; Through our free seminars, our face-to-face counseling, our radio seminars and our advising we have made a significant impact in hundreds of families who have come to our help for their consumer credit education needs.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;Even though our efforts continue to be &lt;strong&gt;based mainly on our local community&lt;/strong&gt;, a community of great needs and expectations, we have also learned throughout this time to make a positive impact in families and people from the entire United States of America, who regularly have come to us and contacted us with their home finances education needs and issues.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;h2&gt;Success&lt;/h2&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;At Premier Consumer Credit Counseling&#xAE;, we have successfully integrated people from different backgrounds and fields, to become an entity with the true identity of helping you become debt free, stay debt free, and more importantly, to become financially educated.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
