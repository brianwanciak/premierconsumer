<br />
Premier Consumer Credit understands the importance of your privacy on the Internet. That is why we believe it is important to let you know how we use the information collected through the PCCC website.</p>

<p>By using this website, you agree to our Internet Privacy and Usage Policy and to the use of the information we receive and collect as stated herein and in ways we may notify you of in the future. By providing any personal information to this site, you acknowledge that you fully understand and consent to the collection and processing of such information.</p>

<p><strong>Information Collection &amp; Use</strong><br />
The following is our policy regarding Internet privacy and usage.</p>

<p>We reserve the right at our discretion to modify this Internet Privacy and Usage Policy at any time. Your continued use of this site following the posting of changes to these terms means you accept these changes.</p>

<p>Premier Consumer Credit Counseling&reg; is the sole owner of the information collected on the Premier Consumer Credit Counseling&reg; Web Site. Premier Consumer Credit Counseling&reg; collects personally identifiable information from our users at several different points on our Web site.</p>

<p><strong>Application Forms</strong><br />
If you request an analysis or fill out any of our information forms, we require that you provide certain personally identifiable information, including your name, address, phone number, amount of debt, income and email address. This information is necessary to process your request and to contact you.</p>

<p><strong>Social Security Numbers</strong><br />
We require the last five digits of you social security number, your member Identification number, and you last name to use our online payment feature and/or to access your account online. When you enter this information on our online payment and/or account access form we encrypt it using secure socket layer technology (SSL).</p>

<p><strong>Surveys</strong><br />
We provide you the opportunity to participate in surveys on our site. If you participate, we will request certain personally identifiable information from you. Participation in these surveys is completely voluntary and you therefore have a choice whether or not to disclose this information. The requested information typically includes contact information (such as name and member ID number), and information on your opinions of the services we provide to you.</p>

<p>We use this information to improve our customer service, to improve the functionality of our website, and to contact you if you request it to address any specific issues.</p>

<p>We will not share the personally identifiable information you provide through a survey with any third parties unless we give you prior notice and choice.</p>

<p><strong>Tell-A-Friend</strong><br />
If you choose to use our referral service to tell a friend about our site, we will ask you for your friend&rsquo;s name and email address. We will automatically send your friend a one-time email inviting him or her to visit the site. Premier Consumer Credit Counseling&reg; stores this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email and tracking the success of our referral program.</p>

<p><br />
<strong>Communications from the Site</strong><br />
<strong>Information and Updates</strong><br />
We will occasionally send you information on services, seminars and reminders. Out of respect for your privacy, we present the option not to receive these types of communications. Please see the &ldquo;Choice and Opt-out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Service-related Announcements</strong><br />
We will send you strictly service-related announcements on rare occasions when it is necessary to do so. For instance, if our service is temporarily suspended for maintenance, we might send you an email.</p>

<p>Generally, you may not opt-out of these communications, which are not promotional in nature. If you do not wish to receive them, you have the option to deactivate your account.</p>

<p><strong>Customer Service</strong><br />
We will communicate with you in response to your inquiries, to provide the services you request, and to manage your account. We will communicate with you by email or telephone, in accordance with your wishes.<br />

Aggregate Information (non-personally identifiable)</p>

<p>We do not link aggregate user data with personally identifiable information.<br />
<br />
Personally identifiable information: We use third parties to provide Online Payment functionality on our site. When you sign up for Online Payment, we will share social security number and member ID number as necessary for the third party to provide that service.</p>

<p>These third parties are prohibited from using your personally identifiable information for any other purpose.</p>

<p><strong>Legal Disclaimer</strong><br />
We reserve the right to disclose your personally identifiable information as required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on our Web site</p>

<p><strong>Choice/Opt-out</strong><br />
We provide you the opportunity to &lsquo;opt-out&rsquo; of having your personally identifiable information used for certain purposes, when we ask for this information. For example, if you purchase a product/service but do not wish to receive any additional marketing material from us, you can indicate your preference on our order form.</p>

<p>If you no longer wish to receive our newsletter and promotional communications, you may opt-out of receiving them by following the instructions included in each newsletter or communication or by filling in the contact form. We offer an opportunity to opt-out of certain communications; you may contact us at 800.296.4950, to opt-out.</p>

<p>We use this information, which does not identify individual users, to analyze trends, to administer the site, to track users&rsquo; movements around the site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. We do not link this automatically-collected data to personally identifiable information. We use a third-party tracking service Xo communications that uses log files to track non-personally identifiable information about visitors to our site in the aggregate to maintain statistical data.</p>
